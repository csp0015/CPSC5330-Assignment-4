Design a simple Clock application. Use concepts learned in Module 4.

Requirements
Show a live clock (format: Wed, 28 Dec 2022 14:59:00) on label1. Based on the time (AM or PM), change the background image. Note: The background image should change automatically (without closing and reopening the app).
Implement a countdown timer using UIDatePicker.
Allow the user to select hours, and minutes.
Start the timer on the button click. Once the timer starts, show the time remaining on label2 (format: 00:10:15).
Once the timer ends, play a music. Choose a music (5-10 seconds) that you like.
Once the timer ends/music starts, change the button text to 'Stop Music'.
Stop the music on the button click. Change the button text to 'Start Timer' and allow users to set a new timer.
The application should run for all size classes, including iPads, and for the landscape orientation.
